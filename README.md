## About
   A simple and functional application that, through a Streamlit app, performs searches for cases in all Brazilian courts and returns the data needed by the law office to proceed with their work.

## Future Work
Currently under construction, it includes an Excel reader and returns multiple cases at once.

## How to Run the Notebook
   1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
   2. Install necessary packages: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`.
   3. Run the notebook cell by cell to observe each step of the analysis and modeling.
